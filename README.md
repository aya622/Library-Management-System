# ðŸ“š Library Management System (C++ & Qt)

This project is a Library Management System built using C++ and the Qt framework. It provides a graphical user interface that allows users to add, view, search, and manage books, articles, theses, digital content, and user information. The system also supports borrowing and returning resources. All data is stored in structured CSV (text) files using Qtâ€™s file handling classes. The project is divided into two parts: core logic written in C++ (`/cpp` folder), and the GUI implementation using Qt (`/gui` folder).
